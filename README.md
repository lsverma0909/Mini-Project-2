# EEC174AY Lab B2

In this lab, you will need to build your environment. <br>
The required packages are: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, ventmap. 

Here are two ways of doing this: <br>
1. Write the Dockerfile to build the image and container from sractch. <br>
2. Reuse your Lab 2's image, build a new container, then run pip3 install ventmap. (This is the new package in this lab.)

When you are creating your container, please 
1. Use last_name_B2 as your container name; <br>
2. Mount the data into your container too. 

The path to data (two folders: data/ and pva_dataset/) used in Lab B2: <br>
Atlas/Kronos: /EEC193/B2_Data/; Hades: /data/EEC193/B2_Data/


This lab is only for 1 week, please start doing it as soon as possible.
